    "There is an old saying that states, a picture is worth a thousand words. People have been using pictures to tell stories and sell ideas for over a century. As data analysts or data scientists today, we are not limited to conducting analysis on data. We also want to use data to help us tell stories. People who can and have the patience to understand complex data are very few. Therefore, we need to use the \"picture\" way to tell our stories to people so that they can \"see\" complex data in the way we expect.\n",

    "## Principles of Good Story Telling\n",
    "\n",
    "Good storytelling via data visualization has two main principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To make the information we want to convey **salient** and **relevant** to the audience.\n",
    "2. To allow the audience to **accurately interpret the information we want to convey.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is good at extracting relevant information from the real world and presenting a sustained **\"snapshot\"** so that the audience can examine in depth over time. However, even in data visualization, the information contained in the charts can still be overwhelming and noisy (i.e. having a lot of irrelevant information to distract the audience from the main point). **Techniques must be employed to highlight the main information we want to convey so that the audience can capture it easily.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One example technique to present salient and relevant information is by using the appropriate visual mode (e.g. color, layout, size, perspective, etc.). Consider the following scenario where the audience is expected to \"see\" how frequent the word data appears in an article. Which of the two presentations allows the audience to capture the information better?"

    "\n",
    "A clear and concise visualization that can be used to determine the existence and type of relationship between two variables is a scatter plot. If we would like to plot 3 variables, we can add additional dimensions to our chart using color or size. However, we should be careful not to overload the chart with information. This will make our chart no longer clear and concise. For more than two variables that we would like to compare pairwise, we may opt to use a scatter matrix instead. A scatter plot can help us detect whether there is a linear relationship between two variables or whether there is a different type of relationship (for example, an exponential or logarithmic relationship). In some cases, we may observe a random distribution of points which means there is no relationship between the two variables. Scatter plots are also useful in identifying outliers and certain aspects underlying in the distribution of our data.\n",
