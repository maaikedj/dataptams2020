    "From the past 5 years, 2018 had the highest peak in new buildings construction costs. It includes buildings such as Dwellings, Offices, Combined company halls, Halls and warehouses, Agricultural sheds and stables, Shops, Schools, and Other Buildings. About 5500 million euros were spent in NL on construction.  \n",
