    "Up until this point, we have been writing Python code in a procedural manner and using functions and methods that are either in Python's standard library or part of some other library such as Numpy or Pandas. This has worked fine for us thus far, but in order to truly graduate from beginner to intermediate Python programmer, you must have a basic understanding of functional programming and be able to write your own functions.\n",

    "## Procedural vs. Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural code is code that is written line by line and executed in the order it is written. It is the style in which most people learn to program due to its straightforward sequence of actions to solve a problem - do this, then do this, then do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "More mature programmers frame problems a little differently. They take more of a functional approach to problem solving, where they create functions consisting of multiple lines of code that accomplish some task and often return a result that can be used by another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a function as a tool - something that helps you perform a job. In a sense, functional programming allows you to create your own tools. Some of these tools will be designed specifically for the current set of tasks you need to perform while other functions you write will be more general and able to be used for other projects. Imagine if a chef were able to construct their own set of knives or a carpenter were able to construct their own set of saws that were perfect for the jobs they needed to perform. That is the power that functional programming gives you as a programmer. Over time, you will develop a personal library of functions that allow you to get your work done more efficiently."

Below is an example of a list2string function that converts lists to strings."

    "In this lesson, we learned about functions in Python. We began the lesson by looking at the differences between writing procedural code and functional code. We then covered how to construct functions in Python and the differences between global and local variables. We ended the chapter by learning how functions can be applied to a Pandas data frame, computing and returning the means of all the numeric columns in a data frame. Now that you have learned about functions, you are well on your way to building a customized set of tools that can help you perform analytical work as efficiently as possible!"
