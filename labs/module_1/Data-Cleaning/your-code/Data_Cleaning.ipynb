    "When working with data sets, you will find that they often require a bit of cleaning. Whether Pandas originally read the data types incorrectly, records are duplicated, the data contains special characters or missing value, or there are slightly different references to the same entity, every data analyst must know how to clean the data they are working with before analyzing it. In this lesson, you will learn about some of the most common problems that make data messy and methods for correcting those problems and cleaning your data.\n",

    "In this lesson, we have learned many techniques for cleaning our data that will make it easier to analyze later. We started the lesson by learning how to examine the data for potential issues. We quickly moved on to finding missing values and incorrect values and correcting them. From there, we learned how to remove low variance columns and identify potential outliers. After that, we learned how to change a column's data type and clean our categorical variables in addition to learning how to identify and remove duplicate records. The techniques you have learned in this lesson are ones that you will find yourself revisiting and utilizing almost every time you prepare to analyze a data set, as most data sets you will encounter will require some level of cleaning."
