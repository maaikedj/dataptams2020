Multiple datasets where used for this project(4). The main dataset and source comes from the Atmo France Federation (Government association), the data can be found here: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organizations/atmo-france/

The focus point on this dataset is information related to the quantity of a substance ('Substance active') in the air ('Concentration ng/m3') on different communes ('Code INSEE') in France over the years ('Annee').

Along this data, there were some other datasets that were needed in order to get the complete geodata and be able to plot the dataset into charts.

There was the commune dataset from France, to get all the info related to the communes and regions (dataset: https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/3720946).

Then there was the actual geodata information about the different communes in France. This data was found in Github (https://github.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson/blob/master/communes.geojson).

Finally, the geodata from Martinique was also needed (https://github.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson/blob/master/regions/martinique/communes-martinique.geojson?short_path=3c3f1cd)
