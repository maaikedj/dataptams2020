One-sided alternative hypothesis (a.k.a. directional hypothesis) is used to determine whether the population average differs from the hypothesized value in a specific direction (larger but not smaller than, or vice versa). **In contrast, two-sided alternative hypothesis (a.k.a. nondirectional hypothesis) is used to determine whether the population average is either greater than or less than the hypothesized value.**\n",

    "Why we differentiate these two types? Because sometimes we are not interested in whether the population average is larger or smaller than the hypothesized value. We only care if they are different. In this case, we use two-sided instead of one-sided hypothesis. However, in case we care about which is the case, we use one-sided hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Our observations must be **independent** of each other. For example, if we have people who live in the same household participating in a medical trial, they might be exposed to the same environmental conditions or eat the same food. This can bias our results.\n",
    "2.   Normality of data - We assume that the sample is derived from a normally distributed data.\n",
    "3.   Adequate sample size. In order to perform a test using the normal distribution and not approximate to the t distribution, our sample size must be greater than 30.\n",
    "4.   In order to use the normal distribution for our hypothesis test, we must assume the population standard deviation is known. If the population standard deviation is not known, then we use the t-distribution for the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also be careful for sampling bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sampling Bias** - Sampling bias occurs when some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others in the selected sample. Say we collected the data at Wall Street at 10AM on Monday. Significant bias can be introduced due to the flaws of the data collection because people who appear at Wall Street at that specific time are most likely working professionals in the financial industry. The sample data will miss a lot of people from other industries and other NYC neighborhoods. Consequently, the selected sample is not a good representation of NYC residents.\n",

We then showed how we can use our test to come up with a conclusion for a real-life scenario and learned how to do this with Python."
