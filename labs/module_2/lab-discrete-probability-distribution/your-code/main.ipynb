So it answers the question: What is the probability of extracting x apples in n=20 number of trials?. For example the probability of extracting x=5 apples (given p_apple=0.6 in this case) is 0.001294 as you calculated, but you can also read it off this plot. The probability of extracting 12 apples out of 20 trials is the highest. At the far end the probability of obtaining 20 apples in 20 trials is also infinitesimal. So the plot is not restricted to the case \"there are 5 apples\". The x axis represents the #apples extracted, or number of successes, the y-axis the corresponding probability of the event."
