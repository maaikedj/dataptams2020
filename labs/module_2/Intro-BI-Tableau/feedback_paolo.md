Great tableau lab Eva, good visualizations and numerical analysis: 
some specfics
- Better to name the sheets according to their content instead of numbers (1,2,3,4..)
- In sheet7 (Total retail transfers by year/month and item type)
  for item Ref, you have a scale (in the 1000) that does not allow to visualize the low numbers well (of the orders of 10). You could opt for a different scale or write numbers instead of bars
- similar comment as for sheet7 also for sheet11 (Total warehose sales by year/month and item type)
- similar comment about using a different scale for sheet12 
- you can have a look here for some alternatives for the tables
