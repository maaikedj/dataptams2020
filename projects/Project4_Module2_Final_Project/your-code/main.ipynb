    "# Project 4: Analysis of pesticide use in different communes in France\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "France is the biggest pesticide consumer of Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "While pesticides are measured in water (European mandatory standard existing for more than 30 years) and in food products, there is no obligation in France or in Europe to measure their presence in the air. So we can't know the amount of pesticides in the air every day. To date, there is no national monitoring plan, nor regulatory limits on the concentrations of pesticides in the air (indoor or outdoor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pesticides can be introduced into the air during application but also after their deposition by volatilizing or by diffusing there through erosion phenomena. The less stable pesticides can also undergo chemical or photochemical degradation and thus produce aerosols and secondary pollutants such as ozone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some pesticides persist in the environment for years after their ban.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outdoor air is more polluted in the countryside than in town. Concentrations are higher in rural areas where there is a clear predominance of insecticides and fungicides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acute poisoning, linked to very high exposure over a short time, can cause poisoning, skin or eye risks. It was for acute intoxication that the farmer Paul François started legal proceedings against the American company Monsanto, which he moreover won.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronic intoxication, linked to lower exposure over a longer time. It can cause many diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, infertility, deformities or even neurological disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comsomption (acute or chronic) of pesticides is linked by 80% to cancer. Pregnant women are a particularly population in danger. Insect life is increidibly endangered by pesticides, around 75% of flying bugs species have dissapeared because of pesticides. Polinisation is also highly affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple datasets where used for this project(4). The main dataset and source comes from the Atmo France Federation (Government association), the data can be found here: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organizations/atmo-france/\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus point on this dataset is information related to the quantity of a substance ('**Substance active**') in the air ('**Concentration ng/m<sup>3</sup>**') on different communes ('**Code INSEE**') in France over the years ('**Annee**'). \n",
    "\n",
    "Along this data, there were some other datasets that were needed in order to get the complete geodata and be able to plot the dataset into charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was the commune dataset from France, to get all the info related to the communes and regions (dataset: https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/3720946).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there was the actual geodata information about the different communes in France. This data was found in Github (https://github.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson/blob/master/communes.geojson).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the geodata from Martinique was also needed (https://github.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson/blob/master/regions/martinique/communes-martinique.geojson?short_path=3c3f1cd)\n"

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we merged our main pesticides sample dataset with the INSEE dataset containing information to the communes and regions. We proceed then to manually fill a Region name for a commune that doesn't have a value in it (Rhône-Alpes) and avoid Pandas errors and to rename some columns, capitalize some values, etc. We proceeded then to remove some unnecesary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular cleaning on this database was related to the communes in France. This dataset contains information that has been recovered since 2002 all the way to 2017. During this period the structure of many communes have changed, either fused with other ones or split, which means changing the geo points, and other information. The 'Martigné-Briand' commune has been moved to a new commune called 'Terranjou' in 2016, and 'Sigolsheim' to 'Kayserberg-Vignoble', also in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we observed that there were observations in the 18th district of Paris. Since there was no specific geodata on the district of Paris, we decided to move it the 'Paris' commune.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some communes that appeared on the polution dataset that were not appearing on the geojson dataset. After careful observation we realised that the missing communes belonged to a DOM (Département d'Outre Mer) of France, to be precise the island of Martinique (Fort de France, Gros Morne, Lamentin, Macouba, Rivière Salée, Sainte Anne). This is the reason why the geojson dataset belonging to Martinique was also needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, we realised when creating the maps that they were taking long time to be rendered, so we decided to filter both geojson datasets to include only the communes that were being evaluated in our polution dataset, that helped speed up enormously the map rendering."

    "- Lindane : insecticide. It can cause nausea, restlessness, headaches, vomiting, shaking, ataxia, tonic-clonic seazures, changes in the EEG. Neurotoxic carcinogenic. Prohibited in 1998\n",
    "- Pendimethaline: herbicide. low acute toxicity. It is slightly toxic by oral and eye administration. Not enough research about this substance.\n",
    "- Fenpropimorphe : impact cell division and growth in plants. Prohibition to comercialize products with it.\n",
    "- Cyprodinil: great health risks. Acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity.\n",
    "- Metholachlore: widely known toxicity. Induces cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human lymphocytes\n",
    "- Chlorothalonil : highly toxic for health fungicide but still not prohibited.\n",
    "- Folpel : prohibition is being discussed. Difficult to evaluate since its disposed quickly from the body. Stomach, esophagus problems linked to it.\n",
    "- Metazachlore: herbicide, not enough information.\n",
    "- Diflufenicanil: herbicide, not enough information.\n",
    "- Kresoxim methyl :  reproductive toxicity. There are limits for the quantities that pose no risk of this product on food, but no research has been done in the air.\n",

    "\n",
    "It could be interesting to focus on why these substances are not the point of interest for research. Is it because its been proven that they have no detrimental effect on health/environment? or maybe they have been banned for a very long time? could it be that the sensors needed to evaluate them are not widely available?

The reason for this is that their values are so much higher than the rest (Folpel is **32,021 ng/m<sup>3</sup>** and Chlorothalonil **2.566 ng/m<sup>3</sup>**), that including the from the beginning would make us loose discriminatory capacity when comparing the values of other substances."

    "- Theres a anormally high concentration of Folpel for the period 2003-2010.\n",
