## Project Description
The game I chose to build is Mastermind, a codebreaking game. I initially got it confused with the quizgame 'Who wants to be a millionaire,' but upon finding out it is, in fact, a codebreaking game I was equally excited.

## Rules
1 Player 1 is the code maker, player 2 is the code breaker. 
2 Player 1 chooses a pattern of four pegs.
3 Player 2 guesses in both order and pattern within 8-12 turns.
4 Each guess is provided by placing a row of pegs on the board.
5 Player 1 returns feedback by placing 0 - 4 pegs in the row by the guess.
6 A coloured or black peg is placed for each guess correct in colour and position. Whereas a white peg indicates a correct colour in the wrong position.
7 Continue with a new guess and repeat.
8 The points are awarded to the correct guesses of the code breaker. 

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
*How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
To organize this project I used Trello to map out my progress. I wrote pseudocode to make a framework of the code.

*What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
