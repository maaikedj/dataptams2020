Good overall Imogen!
Please notice that: 
- You should have created two separate files 'create.sql' and 'seeding.sql' instead of a single one, as it says in the
   lab description README.md.
- You should have used also the statement 'CREATE DATABASE mysql'and 'USE mysql_lab' at the start of your queries 
   otherwise normally your queries would not work. You start with 'create table' without having created the 
  database beforehand
