Shreelatha, your idea was to investigate the relashionship between flights and the Corona virus pandemics. A very original idea!  You developed advanced skills in acquiring the data through API requests. You also developed good, insightful and interactive plots to explain your findings. The notebook looks clean and very organized with introduction, comments and conclusions. The data are on google drive but not on the project drive. The challenging part was that you had too little time to properly develop your analisys and produce a self sufficient notebook. The notebook looks clean and very organized with introduction, comments and conclusions but clear instructions on how to download the data and where to place them were not provided. I could not run the notebook as it was with the instructions provided and could not visualize the plots and follow the analysis. The comments are based on the project presentation. The general advice for next time is to increase a lot the time you devote to analyse the data and make a runnable and easily shareble notebook, and decrease a lot the time you devote to finding the data. We know this is something difficult to predict but try to make it a goal. You developed great techinical skills in acquiring data that will be useful in your future projects.
