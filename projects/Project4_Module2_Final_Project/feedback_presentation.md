Sara, good clear talk. I like that you show only one plot per slide and that you explain it.
My only suggestions are
- Making  the fonts and labels for plots  much bigger because not visible during
presentation
-The conclusions I would decrease the amount of text and use bullet points. That much text is perfect for the 
notebook but probably too much for a presentation.
