# Lab | Machine Learning & AI World
Machine Learning is one of the most trending topics when it comes to high-tech and novel applications. In the media, we often hear a lot about how algorithms are used and shape decision making in high-impact domains such as science, finance and medicine. It is therefore important that you, as a data analyst, know how to read about developments in the field of AI and ML and to keep up-to-date with the latest developments. 

The objectives of this lab are:
* Read the articles and try to get a better understanding of AI and ML within the context of data analytics. 
* Present and discuss your findings with your peers and teachers.

## How we will do it.

You will select an article and a day to present your findings. You will have 10 minutes to share your research with your colleagues and then 10 minutes for another the discussion. We advise you to make a mini-powerpoint with 5 or 6 slides, but feel free to present your conclusions in the way you prefer. 

In particular, we would like you to consider the following: 

* Is the work really groundbreaking? Is it just an exciting application without much use? 
* Where did they get their data from?
* What does the data look like? 
* How did they build the ML model? Which type of model is it?
* Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? 
* Do you find any ethical implications? Collateral effects?
* Do you know of any related news? 

## Dates and times.

We will begin on Saturday May 30th with the first presentation. Who would like to do the first one?

* Saturday May 30th: Victor, Brain AI

We will then have a presentation each session. 

* Tuesday June 2nd: Sreelatha [Spotify recommendation model] 
* Thursday June 4th: [Student] [Topic] 
* Saturday June 6th: [Student] [Topic] 
* Tuesday June 9th: [Student] [Topic] 
* Thursday June 11th: [Student] [Topic]
