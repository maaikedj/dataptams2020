# Good work and good visualizations!!!

Remarks
- You may want to recheck sheet3 (Avg retail sales by year/quarter) and sheet5 (average retail sales by year/month and item type), I get a different numerical result.
- I strongly advice to name the sheets properly and to place titles on the visualizations themselves otherwise it is very difficult to understand what you are plotting!
