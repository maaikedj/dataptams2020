### Great work Sara!!! <br>

### I have only different results for your sheet6 and sheet7, that corresponds to files 7.png and 8.png respectively. Check [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KQDuwNOEefrNck-Bqu8CVKWGLGlxfSlr?usp=sharing)<br>

### As general comment I suggest next time you work on a similar assignement to name the files (sheets) according to the information they show instead of just sheet1,sheet2, etc. In that way it is easier to compare and share results.
