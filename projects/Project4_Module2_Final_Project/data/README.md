## Data  
I'm using the [CITES trade database](https://trade.cites.org/) as data source. This database contains more than 20 million records of trade and is openly accessible. On the website of the database a selection of data can be made for download. I selected my data with the following parameters: 
* Year range: 2000-2019
* Source: W - Wild
* Exporting countries: All countries
* Importing countries: All countries
* Purpose: All purposes
* Trade Terms: Liv - Live
* Taxon: Mammalia

I used the resulting dataset for analysis in the jupyter notebook. The dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wujpJSR6rC7AMeIm_jfcjtQV3lwDohu9).
