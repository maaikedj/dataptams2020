## Project Description
In this project, you will think of a topic, find the data, complete an end-to-end analysis and present the data in multiple ways, all by yourself. First, choose a topic of interest to you and understand what research has already been done in that area. What are some interesting questions that remain? You will then find some data you think could help answer those questions and complete an analysis with relevant visualizations. Last, you will present your findings in a presentation and an **optional** technical paper. 

<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals
* Research and analyse data on a topic of interest to you.
* Apply the programming and statistical techniques we have learned. 
* Create useful and easily-interpretable plots.
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements  
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/YX8EsB2P/project-4-your-own-project).
* You **CANNNOT CODE** until you project is planned.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your branch:

- **A Jupyter notebook** containing your analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis. Place the Jupyter notebook in the `your-code` folder.
- The notebook should be a **self sufficient document**. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebook, understand your analysis and understand where to find the data and how to store the data locally so that the notebooks runs smoothly
- **An empty data folder** with a readme file inside that explains the data set
  
The following deliverables should **not** be pushed to your branch but on group google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13L-r03B3CncSZrzoiGxvbCRvgwEan0qM?usp=sharing)
- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. The link in the notebook can point to the original data set or to our google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13L-r03B3CncSZrzoiGxvbCRvgwEan0qM?usp=sharing) where you can store the data. Please notice that your personal folders have already been made on the google drive where you can store data and presentations.
- Slides and a 12 minute presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13L-r03B3CncSZrzoiGxvbCRvgwEan0qM?usp=sharing)
- Your workflow + documentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13L-r03B3CncSZrzoiGxvbCRvgwEan0qM?usp=sharing). You need to maintain good practices!

## Optional Deliverables
* An **optional** short technical paper including your motivation, methodology and results. (Medium Post?)

* Start the analysis. Remember all the techniques you have learned!

*April 28th*
* One-on-ones.

*Day 30th*

## Presentation  
Presentations will be **EXACTLY** 12 minutes long, with 3 additional minutes for questions. 

<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help but also remember: Google is your friend!
* Start simple! 
* Learn about your subject and understand what research has been done already.
* You *can* use data from the projects your partners did in the last weeks. You can't use your own project.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
* Use the notebook and markdown to guide the reader through your analysis and tell the story
* Explain what insight or information is inferred from your visualizations
* Make extensive use of comments, docstrings and markdown
