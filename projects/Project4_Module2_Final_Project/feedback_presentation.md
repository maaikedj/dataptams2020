Eva, good presentation with insightful plots with good introduction.
Some ideas/suggestions
- In terms of visuals in the comparison-comparisons slides  the plots are a bit too small to be seen clearly,
  I would increase their size. 
- Font in conclusion is too small to be read easily during presentation
- It is more  clear from presentation (not so much from notebook) what you aim at with the correlations or what your insight is.
- I would be curious to know what is the correlation that corresponds to the plots ratio of suicides/gdp_per_capita per country
- Numbers on correlation plots are not readable during presentation
