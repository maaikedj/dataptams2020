## Project Description
The goal of this topic is simple: have another look at one of your earlier projects and provide that project with an additional predictive analysis. You should have some domain knowledge and a lot of insight into the data and possible trends. Now is the time to extent your analysis with a predictive model. For instance, you may want to predict rain fall? Or stock prices? Maybe you found interesting in your HR data and maybe you'd like to see if you can find hidden patterns using the ML techniques we've discussed this module. Thus, the goal of this project is to use your domain-knowledge and knowledge of (a) given data set(s) to perform a predictive, ML analysis. 

<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals
* Revisit and analysis one of your previous projects.
* Apply the programming and ML techniques we have learned. 
* Build and compare at least 3 ML models.
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your models. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements  
* You must plan your project. However, the planning for this project will mainly consists of three steps: (1) research questions; (2) execution; (3) presentation. 
* You **CANNNOT CODE** until you project is planned.

# Necessary Deliverables

**<span style="color:red">The following deliverables should be pushed to your branch:</span>**

**Jupyter notebook(s)** and **Python file(s)** containing your predictive analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis. Place the Jupyter notebook in the `your-code` folder.The notebook should be a **self sufficient document**. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebook, understand your analysis, where to find the data and how to store the data locally so that the notebooks runs smoothly.<br>

**<span style="color:red">The following deliverables should NOT be pushed to your branch:</span>** <br>
- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. 
- **Presentation Slides** A presentation of your results on the day of the presentations. You will have to present using a slideshow or a complete workable programme, **NOT A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.** <br>

<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help but also remember: Google is your friend!
* Start simple! 
* Learn about your subject and understand what research has been done already.
* You *can* use data from the projects your partners did in the last weeks. You can't use your own project.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
* Use the notebook and markdown to guide the reader through your analysis and tell the story
* Explain what insight or information is inferred from your visualizations
* Make extensive use of comments, docstrings and markdown
