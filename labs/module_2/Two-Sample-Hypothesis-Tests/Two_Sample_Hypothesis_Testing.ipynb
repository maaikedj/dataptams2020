    "It is common for researchers to perform studies to compare two groups and check if they behave differently. One example is applying a treatment to one group while another is left untreated. The results are then compared to see if the two groups differ. Hypothesis tests shine the most in such problems where we need to use statistics to inform decision making. In this lesson we will learn about the different ways we can compare two samples to see if they differ significantly."

We will then treat the before and after as two samples and compare them. However, since the two groups both contain the same people, we are able to match each entry in the before data with its corresponding entry of the after data.
