## Project Description
I picked Tic-tac-toe for my first project because it's a classic game and it didn't seem too complicated to code. 

Fun fact: according to Wikipedia, games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE. An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. Tic Tac Toe has been around for a long time!

## Rules
The game is played on a grid that of 3 squares by 3 squares. One player plays with a cross, the other with a circle. Players take turns putting their marks in the empty squares. 

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Workflow
I started with writing down of which parts the code should consist at the minimum, for example, a board to keep score, getting input from the players, printing the board etc. Next, I tried to write this down in pseudocode. Following that, I wrote functions for (almost) each part of the game (some minor things didn't need a function). I finished by putting all these functions together in one function to execute the game with. 

## Organization
I used a Trello board to organize the workflow and timing of my project (see link below).

When developing the game in a jupyter notebook, I tried to break up the code in different sections as much as possible and used a different field for each section, to make error testing easier. 

My repository contains a jupyter notebook with the code for the game, and this readme file. If I will make new version of the game I will add them in separate jupyter notebooks. Currently there is only version 1.
