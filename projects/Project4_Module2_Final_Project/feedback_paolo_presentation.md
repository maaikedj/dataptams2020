Sreelatha, good presentation I like that you show one plot per slide, that makes it easier for the reader
to focus the attention and the plot is easier to appreciate. 
- In general the plots are good but make sure you check the
labels, sometimes they are missing on the y axis. I would use also bigger fonts for the plots.
- The plot 2015-2019 is interesting but be aware that the numbers are not readable. 
I would remove the numbers and leave 
only the colors
- A question that comes to mind and could be a follow up: Is it true then that education buildings are neglected?
If yes why? For example in Amsterdam I know there not enough kindergardens, it is always a struggle for the parents.
So the question could be: if there is a need why are constructor not building educational buildings?
