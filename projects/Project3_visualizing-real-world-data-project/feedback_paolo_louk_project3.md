Zuzanna had a major computer failure and was not able to properly finish the project. From the technical point of view the notebook is far from an acceptable standard as it has no story, no intro no conclusions, it is not runnable because there are absolute paths to the data and not relative ones. The notebook is not self sufficient. The data are provided on google drive and some new interesting plots (like swarm plots) were introduced during the presentation. All in all there is a lot of room for improvement but in a short time of a few hours you were able to put together a basic coherent presentation showing interesting visualizations related the business of the startups.
