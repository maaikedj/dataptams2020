    "I chose to focus on Armed Conflict, as its a subject that interests me and I have read a lot about, but never analyzed. The purpose of this project is to identify the most conflict ridden countries and try to understand from their demographical information if there are other elements that puts them appart from other countries in the same region.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be using a great data source: ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data) this NGO documents all Armed Conflict events, and provides very clear and clean information for each event.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to download data on Africa, Latin America and the Middle East as they are the most conflict-ridden regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand more these regions and their profiles, I also downloaded a data set with some demographic information.\n",
