Maaike, very good presentation very  well told. I like that you start with the questions to focus the attention of 
your audience, I find it a great idea.
Plots are clear, some issues with different scaling, same comments as in notebook. 
The plots in general are clearly visible but the slides with 12 plots are more difficult to view as fonts and labels get smaller. 
There I would break them in two slides at least. Only one additional comment 
but I am really picking here eand it is personal taste: I think the bullet points are great when you have multiple statements
but when you have only one statement I would skip the bullet point. 
All in all great story, you could publish some of these visualizations
in an article, maybe making them interactive.
