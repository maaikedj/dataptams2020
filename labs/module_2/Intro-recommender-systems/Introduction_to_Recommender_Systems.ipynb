    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are a foundational part of the digital world today. **They are used to personalize the experience a user has with a website or application, thus making it more useful to the user.** Some of today's most prominent companies have recommender systems at the core of the customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon recommends you products based on past product purchases, ratings, and the purchases/ratings of other customers similar to you.\n",
    "* Netflix recommends you movies based on the movies you've watched, your rating of movies, and the behavior of other users similar to you.\n",
    "*  Facebook, Twitter, & LinkedIn recommend people you might know based on your connections and the connections of those you are connected to and also use this information to personalize your newsfeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will learn the fundamentals of recommender systems, how they work, and how to create a basic user-based filtering system using Python."

    "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Before recommender systems existed, the primary way to get recommendations about things like movies or products was to ask your friends. As you followed recommendations from them, you would get a sense of which friends had tastes that were most similar to yours and rely on their recommendations more frequently. However, as the number of options available to us has increased drastically over the last few decades, it became increasingly difficult to rely on recommendations from a small group of friends because it also became increasingly likely that they were not aware of all the available options. The solution for this was a method called collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering provides us with a way of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). **The underlying assumption is that if two people have the same opinion on one issue, they are likely to have a similar opinion on other issues as well.** There are a few different ways to approach collaborative filtering, but generally speaking, they involve finding a group of people similar to a user, analyzing the things they like, and coming up with a ranked list of recommendations for the user."

    "### User Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**User similarity** is at the heart of collaborative filtering. In order to make good recommendations, *we need to know how alike two users are*. The way to do this is by comparing how similar their ratings for the same product have been. For example, let's import the movie_ratings.csv file."

    "In this lesson, we provided an introduction to recommender systems and took a look at how we could create a user-based filtering recommender. Along the way, we visualized user preference spaces for pairs of movies, calculated similarity scores between groups of users, and combined those similarity scores with ratings to rank movies so that we could recommend them to a particular user. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to recommender systems, but hopefully this lesson gave you a sense of how these types of systems work and how you might put one together of your very own."
