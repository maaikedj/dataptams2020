    "Rain patterns in RTM have been shifting from 1974 to today. We notice less rainy days, but harder rainfalls when it does rain. Notabily also an increase in violent rainfalls (which means more than 50 lites of water per square meter during an hour). \n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that the first half of the year remains quite stable over the decades, but its the second half, specifically around the summer months where the rain patterns are shifting. According to the KNMI this is due to the increase in temperature. Warmer summer months increase the waterdamp in the air and create more rainfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNMI has created 6 predictions for the future, but in all of them they expect the amount of violent rainfalls to keep increasing and amount of days with rain to decrease, specially in the summer.\n",

    "Its hard to say what effect this will have on our planet, but my grandfather will definitely not be happy as heavy rainfalls ruin his garden, and light rains are the best for his vegetables!!"
