Victor, good presentation I only have two suggestions

- I think the slides do not do justice to the maps plots. Maybe on the slides you could add a zoomed in version of the
  most important maps
- You are a good storyteller and sometimes you get carried away:) forgetting about time. I know you used a timer in this 
  presentation and that is a good step to practice to stay within the given time.
