BETTER READS - Final Project

This is a program that analyzes your GoodReads account, and based on your liked books and similar users, it recommends books.

All data has been downloaded through the API. 
Check the file "1_GoodReads_API.ipynb" to see how.

The data has been downloaded in 2 separate batches, and the csv files have been saved in:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NKTmb9_7g6iWXLdW5z6hNLJyVdIeblB_

File "2_BetterReads_Analysis" was made to clean and inspect the data, and also includes a small analysis and visualization.

File "3_BetterReads_Recommender" is the final recommender program.
