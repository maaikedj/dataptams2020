Armed conflict in Latin America, Middle East and Africa

This project is an analysis and visualization of the armed conflict events from 2019 that happened in Latin America, Middle East and Africa.

The amount and type of events have also been correlated to the demographic profiles of the countries in question, and the below 3 items stood out:

1 - there is a negative correlation between the GDP growth of a country and the total conflicts and fatalities that happened. However, this negative correlation reverses and turns to a possitive correlation for protests.
2 - Education has a low to none correlation between fatalities, but increases for protests, thus more education more protests
3 - all Armed conflict lines are negatively correlated with labor force participation female pop %
