Maaike had a very personal idea to investigate meteorite landings. The code is clear, there are extensive comments and markdown sections among which introduction and conclusion. You are able to start from a dataset and progressively work through the data building more complex and more clear visualizations, reaching the goal of finding your candidate for your next travel. On a technical level you selected the right type of plots, you experimented with geo packages building on the experience of previous projects. Also the story telling element is well developed and the story is well narrated in the notebook and during the presentation. While the main data set is clearly indicated and easy to download and use locally, it appears that there is at least an additional dataset needed to run the notebook. This dataset is not provided. As a result from section 6 onward many cells do not run. Additionally at times we get error related to variables not being defined. The overall advice to counter these problems is, once you are finished working on the notebook, take a break, restart the kernel + clear all outputs and rerun the notebook, looking at it from an external prospective, top to bottom to verify that it is self-sufficient and all data are provided to external users. All in all solid work and visualizations geared towards explanations of the data.
