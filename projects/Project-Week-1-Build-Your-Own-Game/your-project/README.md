## Project Description

I picked Tic Tac Toe for my first project because it is a classic game and it didn't seem too complicated to code. 

Fun fact: according to Wikipedia, games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE. An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. Tic Tac Toe has been around for a long time!

## Rules

The game is played on a grid that of 3 squares by 3 squares. One player plays with a cross, the other with a circle. Players take turns putting their marks in the empty squares. 

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
