Eva decided to analyze and visualize data relative to a marathon in madrid. Good presentation, notebook has intro and conclusions along with extra sections in markdown to implement the explanation. The data are correctly stored and with README file that describes them. The data are retrievable, the visualizations denote in general good choice of the plots. Some more details and questions in the notebook. Over all good work!
