## Project Description
In this project I investigate the international wildlife trade, with a focus on the trade in mammals. The wildlife trade - such as trade in ivory, or pets - is the number one cause of animal extinction, together with habitat destruction caused by land development. A recent study estimates that at least 1/5th of all vertebrate species is being traded (see this [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49904668)). 

Wildlife trade has many negative effects, with the most important ones being:
* Decline and extinction of populations
* Introduction of invasive species
* Spread of new diseases to humans 

In this project, I focus on the trade in endangered mammals as listed by CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. In particular, I analyse trade in live mammals taken from the wild.

## Project Questions
The main research questions I will try to answer in this project are:
* Which wild mammal groups and species are traded the most (in terms of live animals taken from the wild)?
* What are the main purposes for trade of these animals?
* How has the trade changed over the past two decades (2000-2018)?

## Data  
I'm using the [CITES trade database](https://trade.cites.org/) as source for my data. This database contains more than 20 million records of trade and is openly accessible. On the website of the database a selection of data can be made for download. I selected my data with the following parameters: 
* Year range: 2000-2019
* Source: W - Wild
* Exporting countries: All countries
* Importing countries: All countries
* Purpose: All purposes
* Trade Terms: Liv - Live
* Taxon: Mammalia

I used the resulting dataset for analysis in a jupyter notebook. The dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wujpJSR6rC7AMeIm_jfcjtQV3lwDohu9).
